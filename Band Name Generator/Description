This Python script serves as a simple band name generator. Here's how it works:
1. The script starts with a greeting, printing "Hello, User."
2. It then prompts the user to input the name of the city they grew up in by using `input()`. The entered value is stored in the variable `input_1`.
3. Next, the script prompts the user to input the name of their pet using another `input()` statement. The entered value is stored in the variable `input_2`.
4. Finally, the script prints the generated band name by concatenating the user's city name (`input_1`), a space, and the name of their pet (`input_2`).
So, the band name is created by combining the city name and the pet name provided by the user.
For example, if the user inputs "New Delhi" for the city and "Drogon" for the pet, the output might be something like:
```
The name of your band is: New Delhi Drogon
```
